# AT1-Lung-Cancer
## This project used single cell RNA sequencing with SmartSeq2 to compare the transcriptional profile of tumors derived from type 1 alveolar epithelial cells with those derived from type 2 alveolar epithelial cells.
### Cells were isolated from four different mice:
####
-	SW (Sftpc-CreER-rtTA, mTmG) cells are from a mouse in which type 2 alveolar epithelial cells with wildtype Kras were isolated 18 days after tamoxifen was given. 
-	SK (Sftpc-CreER-rtTA, LSL-KrasG12D, mTmG) cells are from a mouse in which AT2 lineage traced cells with the Kras G12D mutation were isolated 18 days after tamoxifen was given. 
-	HW (Hopx-CreER, mTmG) cells are from a mouse in which alveolar type 1 (AT1) and alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells with wildtype Kras were isolated 10 months and 18 days after tamoxifen was given. 
-	HK (Hopx-CreER, LSL-KrasG12D, mTmG) cells are from a mouse in which alveolar type 1 (AT1) lineage traced cells with the KrasG12D mutation were isolated 10 months and 18 days after tamoxifen was given.
